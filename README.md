# The Impact of Climate Change on Birds
Predict the impact of climate change on bird distributions using spatial data and machine learning. 

Climate is changing around the world. This change is impacting species of wild animals. In this project, we will use four decades of bird sightings and climate data to predict the distribution of a bird species in the Scottish Highlands and see how its distribution changed over the years.

This project used R packages including tidyverse and purrr.

We will use data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and a subset of the UKCP09 climate data from the UK Met Office.
